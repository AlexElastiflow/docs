= Automated Linux System Tuning
:description: Learn how Redpanda applies automatic tunic to your Linux system.

Redpanda includes numerous features for tuning your Linux systems for optimal performance. Users may trigger hardware-based optimizations through the `rpk redpanda tune` command, known as the autotuner. Software-based configurations are managed automatically through the `systemd` suite of tools. These features and their respective areas of concern are described here.

== User-triggered tuning
=== Uses rpk redpanda tune
=== Optimizes the linux kernel for Redpanda
== Redpanda uses systemd for configurations
=== Among other things, configures memlocks, file handle limit, process limit, core limits, and certain distro-specific configurations
=== Also ensures AIO and scheduler affinity are applied properly
=== Monitors for infinite looping scenarios
=== Employs systemd cgroups slices to isolate workloads and ensure stability and  protect resources
