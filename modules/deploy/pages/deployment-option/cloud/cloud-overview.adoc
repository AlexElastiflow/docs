Redpanda Cloud is a complete streaming data platform delivered as a fully-managed service with automated upgrades and patching, data and partition balancing, and 24x7 support. It continuously monitors and maintains your clusters along with the underlying infrastructure to meet strict performance, availability, reliability, and security requirements. All Redpanda Cloud clusters are deployed with an integrated Redpanda Console.

== Cluster types

Redpanda offers three types of fully-managed cloud clusters:

* <<Serverless>>: Clusters are hosted in Redpanda Cloud. This is the fastest and easiest way to start data streaming in the cloud. With pay-as-you-go billing, you only pay for what you consume.
* <<Dedicated Cloud>>: Single-tenant clusters are hosted in Redpanda Cloud. This provides more control over your deployment. 
* <<Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)>>: Clusters are hosted in your private cloud. This provides more control over your deployment and offers full data sovereignty. You can subscribe with committed use in Google Cloud Marketplace or AWS Marketplace. 

=== Serverless

With Serverless clusters, you host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance. They are available instantly with no base cost.

Your applications talk to Serverless over the public internet using encrypted connections. Serverless does not support private networking (that is, VPC peering to talk over private IPs). Use Dedicated clusters for private networking.

Available on AWS.

=== Dedicated Cloud

With Dedicated clusters, you host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. Dedicated clusters are single-tenant deployments for better data isolation. 

Available on AWS or GCP. 

=== Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

With BYOC clusters, you deploy Redpanda in your own VPC, so all data is
contained in your own environment. There are no inbound connections from the Redpanda
control plane to the data plane. This provides an additional layer of security
and isolation. Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. 

Setting up a BYOC cluster is initiated from the Redpanda control plane. This is a two-step process performed using `rpk`:

. You bootstrap a virtual machine (VM) in your VPC. This VM spins up the agent
and the required infrastructure.
. The agent communicates with the control plane to pull the cluster specifications.

When provisioning BYOC, at the time an agent is deployed, Redpanda assigns the
necessary IAM policies required to run the agent.

NOTE: With standard BYOC clusters, Redpanda manages security policies and resources for your VPC, including subnetworks, service accounts, IAM roles, firewall rules, and storage buckets. For the most security, you can manage these resources yourself with a xref:./vpc-byo-gcp.adoc[customer-managed VPC].

Available on AWS or GCP. 

== Serverless vs Dedicated/BYOC

Serverless clusters are a good fit for the following:

* Starter and growing workloads
* Spiky workloads (development environments, systems that only occasionally get busy, or workloads that come and go), only paying for what you consume, without any commitment
* Fast and dynamic cluster creation: you can use a Serverless cluster as an isolated container for topics

Because a Serverless cluster is created in under one second, you can surface it in your applications (for example, for tenant isolation). As your workload increases, you can can migrate a Serverless cluster to a Dedicated or BYOC cluster.

Dedicated and BYOC clusters offers the following features:

* Single-zone or multi-zone availability (a multi-zone cluster provides higher resiliency in the event of a failure in one of the zones)
* Private networking using VPC peering
* Ability to export metrics to a 3rd-party monitoring system
* Managed connectors
* Unlimited retention with glossterm:Tiered Storage[]

Consider Dedicated or BYOC if you need any of the following:

* Control over cluster settings
* Control over the deployment
* Private networking
* Workloads with consistently-high throughput

== Cluster tiers

When you create a BYOC or a Dedicated Cloud cluster, you select your throughput tier. The following table lists current AWS and GCP tier limits. Legacy tiers may have different limits. For more information, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[support^]. 

|=== 
| Tier | Maximum ingress | Maximum egress | Maximum partitions | Maximum connections

| Tier 1 | 20 MBps | 60 MBps | 1,000 | 1,500
| Tier 2 | 50 MBps | 150 MBps | 2,800 | 3,750
| Tier 3 | 100 MBps | 200 MBps | 5,600 | 7,500
| Tier 4 | 200 MBps | 400 MBps | 11,300 | 15,000
| Tier 5 | 400 MBps | 800 MBps | 22,800 | 30,000
| Tier 6 (BYOC only) | 800 MBps | 1,600 MBps | 45,000 | 60,000
| Tier 7 (BYOC only) | 1,200 MBps | 2,400 MBps | 50,000 | 90,000

NOTE: Serverless clusters aren't deployed on tiers. For more information, see xref:deploy:deployment-option/cloud/serverless.adoc#limitations[Serverless cluster limits].

== Cloud architecture

Redpanda Cloud uses a control plane and data plane architecture. The control
plane configures and maintains cluster agents, which are
self-contained and independent of the control plane.

=== Control plane

The control plane is a separate entity that enforces rules in the data plane. The
control plane is where a good deal of your Redpanda cluster management, operations,
and maintenance takes place. While Redpanda Cloud clusters are configured and
maintained in the control plane, they are self-contained and remain available
even if the network connection to the control plane is lost.

=== Data plane

The data plane is where your Redpanda cluster resides in Redpanda Cloud; it is
self-contained and managed by an agent that receives cluster specifications from the
control plane. Redpanda Cloud clusters are interchangeably referred to as
data planes. All network connections into the data plane take place through
either a public endpoint or a Redpanda Cloud virtual private cloud
(VPC) peering network connection.

=== Agent

The Redpanda Cloud agent, also known as the data plane agent, provisions,
configures, and maintains all the resources in the Redpanda Cloud cluster, from
the network all the way up to the Redpanda cluster and connectors infrastructure.
Data plane resources include cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and data plane software
artifacts.

Agents can be bootstrapped in two different ways: automatically by a machine
or manually by a human. The human-driven agent bootstrap is designed for
BYOC deployments. After the agent is up and running,
it connects to the control plane and starts dequeuing and applying cluster
specifications that provision, configure, and maintain Redpanda Cloud clusters.

The agent is in constant communication with the Redpanda Cloud control plane,
receiving and applying cluster specifications and exchanging cluster metadata.
Agents are authenticated and authorized through opaque and ephemeral tokens, and
have dedicated job queues in the control plane. In BYOC, you can provision,
configure, and maintain agents using `rpk`.

Redpanda Cloud agents also manage VPC peering networks. However,
only one agent manages each network resource at a time.

The following diagram identifies the resources, operations, and connections
that exist in and between the control plane and data plane.

== Redpanda Cloud vs self-hosted feature compatibility

Redpanda Cloud does not support the following self-hosted functionality:

- mTLS
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication
- Kerberos authentication
- Data transforms
- Remote Read Replicas
- Redpanda Console topic documentation
- Setting `auto_create_topics_enabled=true` for BYOC and dedicated clusters
- Admin API
- The following `rpk` commands (which use the Admin API):

** `rpk acl user`
** `rpk cluster health`
** `rpk cluster config`
** `rpk cluster license`
** `rpk cluster maintenance`
** `rpk cluster partitions`
** `rpk cluster self-test`
** `rpk cluster storage`
** `rpk generate app`
** `rpk redpanda`
** `rpk topic describe-storage` (all other `rpk topic` commands are supported on both Redpanda Cloud and self-hosted)
