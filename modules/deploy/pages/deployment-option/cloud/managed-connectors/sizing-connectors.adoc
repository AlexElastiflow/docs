== What is a connector task?
When you set up a connector, its main responsibility is to validate the specified configuration and spawn tasks.
The actual work is performed by the connector tasks. Setting multiple tasks for a connector allows to pararelize the
work, resulting in higher throughputs. 

Before setting up connector tasks, consider the following:

- for source connectors, the possibility to increase tasks to achieve higher througput depends entirely on the specific
connector implementation and configuration, and for many of them only 1 connector task is possible (e.g. for Debezium
connectors only 1 task can be used).

- for sink connectors, the pararelizm is achieved by evenly distributing partitions of topics configured for the
connector between tasks. The number of partitions needs to be equal or higher than the number of tasks.

== What throughput can a single task provide?
Connector throughput depends on many factors, including converters used, compression, message size, performance of
external system. As a rule of thumb you may expect a single connector task to provide 1-2 MB/s of throughput.

== How many tasks should I set for a sink connector?
It not easy or obvious to determine the number of tasks to use for a given workload, so you need to experiment to find
the right number. Start with low number of tasks and wait a couple of minutes to see how it performs. Keep increasing
the number of tasks until safisfactory throughput is achieved. Keep in mind that the underlying infrastructure needs to
scale to provide place for more tasks. Waiting ~10 min after each change gives time for the system to scale up.
