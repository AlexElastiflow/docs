== Connector tasks
When you set up a connector, its main responsibility is to validate the specified configuration and spawn tasks.
The actual work is performed by _connector tasks_. Setting up multiple tasks for a connector allows for parallelization of the
work, resulting in higher throughputs. 

Before setting up connector tasks, consider the following:

- for source connectors, the possibility to increase tasks to achieve higher througput depends entirely on the specific
connector implementation and configuration, and for many of them only 1 connector task is possible (e.g. for Debezium
connectors only 1 task can be used).

- For sink connectors, parallelism is achieved by evenly distributing configured topic partitions for the connector amongst connector tasks. The number of partitions must be equal to or greater than the number of tasks.

== Single task throughput
Connector throughput depends on many factors, including converters used, compression, message size, and the performance of external systems. As a rule of thumb, expect a single connector task to provide 1-2 MB/s of throughput.

== Specify number of connector tasks for a sink connector
It not easy or obvious to determine the number of tasks to use for a given workload, so you need to experiment to find
the right number. Start with low number of tasks and wait a couple of minutes to see how it performs. Keep increasing
the number of tasks until safisfactory throughput is achieved. Keep in mind that the underlying infrastructure needs to
scale to provide place for more tasks. Waiting ~10 min after each change gives time for the system to scale up.
